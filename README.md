## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:
- Zoho CRM Account with premium features and a module to store Read Ai data.
    1. Create a module to store incoming data from Read Ai, such, name it as you wish, for example `Read AI meetings`, you can do it in [Zoho CRM add module option](https://crmplus.zoho.com/test6295/index.do/cxapp/crm/org860067954/settings/modules/create)
    2. Add required fields for the module layout:
        - start_time as Date/Time.
        - end_time as Date/Time.
        - summary as Multi-Line.
        - report_url as URL.
        - session_id as Single Line.
        - Participants as Subform with name and Email.

         Note: if you need it, you can access to [Modules and Fields](https://crmplus.zoho.com/test6295/index.do/cxapp/crm/org860067954/settings/modules) to modify any module layout.
    3. Click on `Save and Close` to store the module layout.
    
    - If necesary to debug a connection, it might be helpul to check the Zoho CRM [Api names](https://crmplus.zoho.com/test6295/index.do/cxapp/crm/org860067954/settings/api/modules).

- Read AI Account with premium features.
    - Go to [Webhooks](https://app.read.ai/analytics/integrations/user/workflow/webhooks) and click on `Add webhook`.
    - Add the base URL were the APi is deployed + the end point `/meetings/new`, example: `https://readai-2-zoho-api.onrender.com/meetings/new`

### Deployment

This API can be deploy on multiple services, a service that I prefer is render, if you like to use this service you can deploy following this Render article [Deploying Ruby on Rails on Render](https://docs.render.com/deploy-rails)

Once the Application is Deployed, please add the `https://base-url.com/meetings/new` end point into your weebhook in Read Ai to start the connection. See prerequistes for info about Read Ai and Zoho CRM.
